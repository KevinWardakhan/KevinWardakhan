## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Wardakhan, a Masterâ€™s student at Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure Paris-Saclay specializing in data science and applied mathematics. Iâ€™m completing the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) program (Mathematics, Vision, Learning) one of Europeâ€™s leading AI masterâ€™s, where I focus on advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and deep learning.

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview
- **[Implementation of ProGAN](https://github.com/KevinWardakhan/ProGAN)**<br>
  Variant of GANs to generate high quality images. Trained and tested on [CelebA-HQ](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lamsimon/celebahq) dataset.

- **[Industrial Digital Twin](https://github.com/KevinWardakhan/Industrial-Digital-Twin) (PHATE + PGAN)**<br>
  Showcases a 3-month data science internship project: a digital twin for an industrial unit with virtual sample generation and quality checks.

- **[Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction (GLM Project)](https://github.com/KevinWardakhan/GLM_project)**  
  Using Generalized Linear Models to predict urban bike rentals based on weather, time, and contextual factors.

- **[Monte Carlo Methods Project](https://github.com/KevinWardakhan/monte-carlo-project)**  
  Implementation of multiple Monte Carlo techniques (inverse CDF, accept-reject, stratified sampling) for probability estimation.

- **[Plagiarism Detection Tool (C Language Project)](https://github.com/KevinWardakhan/plagiat_detector)**  
  Static code analysis in C to detect plagiarism between multiple source files, with visual output in `.pgm` format.

- **[Stack Machine Simulator (C Language Project)](https://github.com/KevinWardakhan/pile_project)**  
  Design and simulation of a stack-based virtual machine, including assembler and instruction-level execution.

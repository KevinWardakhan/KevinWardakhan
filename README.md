## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, I'm Kevin Wardakhan, a student at UniversitÃ© Paris Dauphine - PSL, passionate about data science and applied mathematics.

I'm currently exploring advanced statistical models, machine learning, and automation projects.  
I enjoy working on practical problems and building clean, efficient solutions â€” from data analysis to backend development.

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview

- **Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction (GLM Project)**  
  Using Generalized Linear Models to predict urban bike rentals based on weather, time, and contextual factors.

- **Monte Carlo Methods Project**  
  Implementation of multiple Monte Carlo techniques (inverse CDF, accept-reject, stratified sampling) for probability estimation.

- **Plagiarism Detection Tool (C Language Project)**  
  Static code analysis in C to detect plagiarism between multiple source files, with visual output in `.pgm` format.

- **Stack Machine Simulator (C Language Project)**  
  Design and simulation of a stack-based virtual machine, including assembler and instruction-level execution.

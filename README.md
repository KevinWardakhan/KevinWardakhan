## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m Kevin Wardakhan, a Masterâ€™s student at Ã‰cole Normale SupÃ©rieure Paris-Saclay specializing in data science and applied mathematics. Iâ€™m completing the MVA program (Mathematics, Vision, Learning) one of Europeâ€™s leading AI masterâ€™s, where I focus on advanced statistical modeling, machine learning, and automation. I love tackling real-world problems and building clean, efficient solutions end-to-end, from data analysis to backend development.

## ðŸš€ Projects Overview
- **Implementation of ProGAN**
  Variant of GANs to generate high quality images. Trained and tested on CelebA-HQ dataset.

- **Industrial Digital Twin (PHATE + PGAN)**
  Showcases a 3-month data science internship project: a digital twin for an industrial unit (CarbOptim) with virtual sample generation and quality checks.

- **Bike-Sharing Demand Prediction (GLM Project)**  
  Using Generalized Linear Models to predict urban bike rentals based on weather, time, and contextual factors.

- **Monte Carlo Methods Project**  
  Implementation of multiple Monte Carlo techniques (inverse CDF, accept-reject, stratified sampling) for probability estimation.

- **Plagiarism Detection Tool (C Language Project)**  
  Static code analysis in C to detect plagiarism between multiple source files, with visual output in `.pgm` format.

- **Stack Machine Simulator (C Language Project)**  
  Design and simulation of a stack-based virtual machine, including assembler and instruction-level execution.
